This workflow will trigger on two events: when a new code commit is pushed to the main branch, and when a new discussion is created in the repository. If the discussion is related to code improvement suggestions, the workflow will generate tips and suggestions from GPT-3 and add them as comments to the discussion. If the discussion is not related to code improvement, the workflow will simply ignore it.
